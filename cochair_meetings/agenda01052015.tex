\begin{agendaitem}{0}{Come prepared with a laptop and make sure you have access to the CS Women Trello boards.}
I also recommend either printing out this agenda or pulling the source off github to take notes.
\end{agendaitem}

\begin{agendaitem}{20}{Introductions, post-mortem on last semester.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What should be done differently? 
        \item What were our objectives? Did we reach them? 
        \item \actionitem{Identify one small, easily accomplished improvement for this semester and post this on the CSWomen Trello.} 
        \item \actionitem{Identify one large goal for this semester and write a blog post about this.} 
    \end{enumerate} 
\end{agendaitem}

\begin{agendaitem}{15}{Delegate responsibilities for upcoming events.}
    Proposed events can be found on the \href{http://umasscswomen.weebly.com/events.html}{\underline{CS Women's Events Page}}. Details can be found on the Trello board, where most of this discussion should take place. I've included here the most time-sensitive or items in greatest need of group discussion. 
    
    \paragraph{Clothing Swap.} This should be done at the start of the semester (i.e., two weeks or so). We will need minimal resources and the event should cost us little to nothing. We will need to \actionitem{agree to host this event}, \actionitem{book a room}, and \actionitem{draft a description of the event and an invitation}. \emph{Update (01/07/15): We've booked 150/151 from 5-8pm on 1/22/15}
    
    \paragraph{Chinese New Year} occurs on Feb. 19th. We will need someone to \actionitem{take responsibility for this event and brainstorm activities}. 
     
    \paragraph{Egg Drop Contest.} I think this event is best suited for later in the semester. However, we will need to do quite a bit of preparation. We should email the group now, asking for \actionitem{materials ``donations.''}
\\\\    
       Regardless of what we decide to do regarding events, we will need to \actionitem{email the CS Women group a link to the events page} so that anyone who has ideas for events or wants to get involved knows how. 
\end{agendaitem}

\begin{agendaitem}{15}{Decide what to do about the lunches.}
    Do we still want to hold lunches?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {\bf Yes.} We will need to \actionitem{book the room(s) now} and sketch a preliminary 
        plan for the topic of each meeting. \emph{Update (01/07/15): We've booked 151 for the lunches; see the calendar for the exact dates.}
        \item {\bf No.} Discuss:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item What is the goal of the lunches?
                \item Are the lunches deficient in some way?
                \item The department pays for the lunches; will we ``lose'' that money if we don't use it?
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{agendaitem}

\begin{agendaitem}{10}{Discuss Formal Documentation.}
    We should so some meta-planning. The group does not have a charter, nor are the roles documented. This should be a preliminary discussion that will be continued throughout the semester. Those interested in working on documentation should meet separately to draft the documents, which will later need to be ratified by the group.
\end{agendaitem}

\begin{agendaitem}{15}{Department Stats, Outreach, etc.}
We still don't know who our members are or should be. Discuss ways to find out how many students we should be reaching vs. how many we are.
\paragraph{WeCode event}
\emph{Update from Niha (01/08/15):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item All tickets have been purchased. 
        \item Camille from MHC is trying to organize transport for all 5 colleges. Transportation costs will be split up among the five colleges in proportions to the number of students attending from each college.
        \item Leeanne from UMass is helping coordinate transport with Camille.
        \item We still have 5 people on the waitlist. Once transport is confirmed we will know how big our buses/vans are going to be. Depending on the available seats, we will take people off waitlist. Lori has already agreed to fund 5 more tickets.
    \end{enumerate}
    }
\end{agendaitem}

\begin{agendaitem}{5}{Roles and Responsibilities}
Discuss any specialized roles we need (e.g., webmaster, social network maintainer, lunch organizer) and whether they should be delegated to co-chairs or additional committees.
\end{agendaitem}
