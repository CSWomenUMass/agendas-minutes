\begin{agendaitem}[10]{First Lunch Speaker/Event}
  Our first lunch is scheduled for Feb. 11. If we want a speaker, we
  will need to pick one soon and send them an invitation.
\end{agendaitem}

\begin{agendaitem}{10}{Discuss Formal Documentation.}
    We should so some meta-planning. The group does not have a
    charter, nor are the roles documented. This should be a
    preliminary discussion that will be continued throughout the
    semester. Those interested in working on documentation should meet
    separately to draft the documents, which will later need to be
    ratified by the group.
